Counting Words in a File


For this assignment I had to write a console application that read and counted a specific number of words from a file. The words specifically had to end with the letter "t" or "e" and the combined number of both was to be displayed to the console. I achived this by using a while and for loop in my program.

Attached, I had included a screenshot of the code, the textfile used, and the console result.
